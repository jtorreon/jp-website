      <h1>Cebu trips</h1>
      <p>Exploring a new place is always exciting but if you only have a day or even half to spare, what do you do? In case you happen to visit Cebu, you can simply choose any of the popular day trips below. You can still have a grand time with your friends and family even with a very tight schedule ahead.</p>

        <h3>Beaches</h3>
        <p>Being an island province with more than 150 smaller islands and islets, the province of Cebu is also home to some of the most beautiful beaches in the country. Some of which are hidden gems. While some are very popular with tourists known for their white sands, turquoise waters, and diving spots.</p>

        <h3>Themed Parks</h3>
        <p>You've probably pondered why Cebu is one of every tourist's favorite vacation spots when it comes to beaches, falls, lakes, springs, and many more. Undeniably, the city is endowed with rich historic culture and attractions which adds to its tourist charm. At the heart of Visayas' central pillar for commerce, trade, education, and industry, the city has more to offer as the country's second-largest metropolitan area. But, that's not all! Cebu also has the best theme parks and waterparks in the country!</p>

        <h3>Canyoneering</h3>
        <p>Cebu is an island known for its beaches, great diving sites, and numerous waterfalls. In Cebu south is a whole new adventure to go downstream canyoneering and jumping off waterfalls. Are you in for a bit of adventure and a lot of amazing nature sceneries?</p>

        <h3>Hiking</h3>
        <p>The hilly landscape of Cebu lends itself well to hikes. This narrow and slim island—you know what, let’s just call it sexy—spans nearly 200 kilometers from north to south and over 30 kilometers from east to west. With all that space, it is home to some of the most sought-after hiking trails in the country, all of which have breathtaking views that make the climb worth it.</p>

        <h3>Foods</h3>
        <p>Cebu is also a food mecca where visitors can taste some of the greatest Philippine cuisines. Cebu is best known for its delicious Lechon, a roasted suckling pig on a pit, and a local snack called the Puso, a heart-shaped delicacy of hanging rice wrapped in coconut fronds. There's also the SuTuKil dining experience, a gastronomic adventure where you can have the seafood cooked according to your preference. It can be prepared as ceviche, grilled, or cooked with broth.</p>

    <h1>Experience</h1>
    <p>So, you’re traveling to Cebu? Are you here for pleasure or business? No matter the reason, you are fortunate to step foot on this beautiful island. Did you know that Cebu is the first ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) City of Culture? 
    Moreover, this island houses the Philippines’ top tourist attractions. Therefore, you would want to be able to return home and say, “I have truly experienced Cebu!”.</p>

    <p>Cebu is one of the most popular destinations in the Philippines. Because it has an international airport, many people touchdown in Cebu from overseas, and this is their first destination for their Philippines adventure.
    There are so many things to do in Cebu that unfortunately, most tourists do one or two and then head to another island. This is a big mistake as you can have an adventure-packed week or more on Cebu alone! These are all of the places I have personally visited in Cebu so far and you can click the links throughout the article to visit the individual blog posts about each location.
    * We will keep updating this guide with more of the epic waterfalls, viewpoints, and diving spots on the beautiful island of Cebu. <a href="#">Learn more</a></p>

    <h1>We have a plastic problem</h1>
    <p>Our oceans are facing growing challenges from pollution, habitat loss, development, and climate change. The impact of plastic and micro-plastics to our seas is outrageous and devastating for many species. Learn more about what you can do to stop it.</p>
    <h3>Here are just a few chilling facts:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>It is estimated that by 2050, oceans will carry more plastic mass than fish</li>
      <li>Plastic waste kills up to 1 million sea birds, 100,000 sea mammals, marine turtles and countless fish each year</li>
      <li>80% of all pollution in seas and oceans comes from land-based activities</li>
      <li>It's not just animals: people are consuming micro plastics too. Ewwww!</li>
      <li>A garbage truck’s worth of plastic is dumped into the ocean every single minute</li>

      <h1>Take action right now!</h1>
      <p>For a healthy planet, we need healthy oceans. Oceans cover 70% of the earth’s surface and they are seriously under threat. We all need to do our part. Here are some things you can do right now:</p>
    </article>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h1>01</h1>
        <h4>Climate change</h4>
        <p>-It's making oceans hotter, promoting acidification, and making it harder for marine life to breathe by reducing dissolved oxygen levels. We can reduce our own carbon footprint and help decelerate climate change by making smart choices about what we eat and how we travel. <a href="#">Learn more</a></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h1>02</h1>
        <h4>Plastic Pollution</h4>
        <p>We can all help by refusing single-use plastics such as straws, cutlery, and food containers. These are in our lives for seconds, but spend centuries circulating in our oceans, causing significant damage. Don’t support businesses that are using single-use plastics. <a href="#">Learn more</a></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h1>03</h1>
        <h4>Sustainable Seafood</h4>
        <p>Do you know where your food is coming from, how and where it is caught? Long line fishing is extremely disruptive to our oceans. It can trap thousands of by-catch animals, and nets are often lost at sea and become death traps for many animals. The practice of over-fishing certain species is creating a huge imbalance in our sea-based populations. <a href="#">Learn more</a></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h1>04</h1>
        <h4>Fisheries subsidies</h4>
        <p>Every year, governments spend billions on fisheries subsidies, the majority of which directly accelerate harmful overfishing. Subsidies lead to too many fishing fleets and vessels that can remain out at sea longer and decimate populations in certain areas. <a href="#">Learn more</a></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h1>05</h1>
        <h4>Marine protection</h4>
        <p>Today, only 2% of our global oceans are protected marine parks. (Remember that the ocean covers 70% of our earth!) Scientists estimate we may need to protect 30% of the oceans to provide properly for the future of ocean wildlife and ocean health. Make sure your representatives know that these issues are important to you! <a href="#">Learn more</a></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h1>06</h1>
        <h4>Apex predators</h4>
        <p>Our apex predators, like sharks, play a critical role in regulating the eco-system -and they need our help! Sharks are especially vulnerable to overfishing. As a result of fishing pressures, a third of shark species are already threatened with extinction. <a href="#">Learn more</a></p>
